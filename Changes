  the origiganl encoded content, but the analyzer gets the
  decoded content
0.94 2013-02-07
- major rewrite of Request.pm and IMP.pm:
  - don't use InspectChain any longer in Request,

- improve debug message - non-printable as \OOO etc
- fix handling of responses with no content-length (or with content-length
  removed due to uncompressing)

  - use typed buffers instead of stream handling internally
  - adapt CSRFprotect to use these
- various bug fixes
0.4 2012-11-28
